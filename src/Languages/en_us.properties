About=<html><body style="font-family:Arial Unicode MS"<font size="3">This program emerges from the need to create a mnemonic method with the use of images associated with a list of preloaded words.<br/> <br/> [Like a cup of tea] <br/> <b>Miguelangel Garc\u00eda (NewKey)<br/><br/>Libraries:<br/></b> JSoup, Zip4j, Sql2o, Sqlite, JSon, Apache Commons <br/> <br/><b>Info.DankiMG@gmail.com</b> <br/> Thanks to:<br/> S.

HowI_C=<html>I'm a Engineering student born and raised in Venezuela, with the great aspiration of being helpful to the Internet community with my future works. <br><br> Being born in Venezuela is a challenge everyday, even though my computer is too old, my internet connection speed is the slowest of the continent, I'm still working, and it's not just me, but also all the people who want to succeed and exceed the needs by creating new routes to reach success. <br><br> If you like my work, please consider to donate. It would really help my university fees and college tuition in Venezuela (South America).<html>
